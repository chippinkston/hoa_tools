#Definitions
##Overview
All entries in this directory will describe the basic assumptions of the various concepts in the system.  Functional aspects of interacting with these elements will be specified as features within the overall Specification Features section (see `Testing`).
  
These assumptions should be sufficient to describe the general structure of the data entities needed to represent these concepts (i.e. the base Objects).  Each requirement will have a block of `Required` attributes and a block of `Optional` attributes.

From a data persistence perspective, `Required` items should compromise the primary record.  `Optional` attributes will be addressed on a case by case basis as to if they require a separate requirements definition.  If so, they will be added to the overall requirements, otherwise, it is assumed that they will be stored with the base entity's record.
